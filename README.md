# diveplusdata
repository for datasets for the DIVE Plus demonstrator See http://diveproject.beeldengeluid.nl.  Currently we have partial data from four collections and three vocabularies. These are in RDF Turtle. 

# Open Images
Consisting of the video collection itself as well as the GTAA thesaurus
**Open Images collection**
Originally from openbeelden.nl (3000 videos)
Creative Commons â€“ Attribution-Share Alike license (CC-by-SA)
Subset in DIVE triple store is all videos from OpenImages, as found in an existing RDF conversion. For 510 videos crowd enrichments are added with relations entities, events, persons, places through crowdsourcing.

**GTAA** (Gemeenschappelijke Thesaurus Audiovisuele Archieven). 
From http://gtaa.beeldengeluid.nl . Entities from KB are also matched to this thesaurus.

All Open images content can be found in the oi_dive folder:
* al_oipers_to_gtaapers.ttl	alignments from crowdsourced persons to GTAA 
* al_oiplace_to_gtaageo.ttl	alignments from crowdsourced locations to GTAA 
* al_oirest_to_gtaaall.ttl	alignments from crowdsourced concepts to GTAA 
* gtaa_clean.ttl.gz	GTAA dump 
* oi_collectiontriples.ttl	triples registering media objects to a collection
* oi_enrichments.ttl	crowdsourced enrichments 
* oi_schema_mappings.ttl	OI to Dive schema mappings
* oi_sources.ttl	for sources and placeholders (thumbnails and video locations)
* openbeelden.ttl	Openimages collection, earlier dump by Michiel Hildebrand 
* void.ttl VOID file, includes library statements for ClioPatria


# Radio bulletins from KB

Update: The ANP news bulletins from 1955-1973 are now also added to the RDF dataset. The turtle file has been split and gzipped. Note that this part of the data has not been tested yet.

Originally from http://www.delpher.nl/nl/radiobulletins. Size is 1.5 millions of items ANP has made the objects (JPGs, OCRs, ALTOs) in this set available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0 license (link is external).

These are *all* news bulletins between 1937 (start of collection) and May 1955 (when my script crashed initially). 
* The original XML docs were retrieved from the KB server using OAI-PMH (my application crashed when this arrived at May '55). 
* The XML was converted to RDF using a python script: https://github.com/biktorrr/dive/blob/master/kb/get_kb_data_new.py 
** This script actually calls another KB API which does NER on the OCR'ed text of the bulletin
** Each bulletin becomes a MediaObject and links to exactly one Event (the news event mentioned in the bulletin'. 
** The label of this Event is a 'best guess' based on the OCR'ed description of the bulletin. This of course leads to many 'hard to read' labels, but that is something we need to learn to live with. I improved the labeling a bit. An example of such a label is http://purl.org/collections/nl/dive/kb/evt-anp:1953:11:19:56 or http://purl.org/collections/nl/dive/kb/evt-anp:1953:02:15:49 
** Persons, places and actors found in the text are saved as Dive entities and linked to the Event.  For example, the location 'Middelburg' http://purl.org/collections/nl/dive/kb-loc-Middelburg
** Persons, places and actors are aligned with GTAA 
* This results in 
** 197,199 Media Objects (around 80 more than previous collection)
** 5,389,556 RDF triples in the main KB graph (now the largest named graph in the triple store: http://data.dive.beeldengeluid.nl/browse/list_graphs 
** Around 6,000 alignments 
		

OLD: Subset in DIVE triple store is 2210 digitized typoscripts (radio news scripts, to be read during news broadcasts) from the period 1937-1984.These were chosen to match the Openbeelden subset by re-using terms found there for the search request. 

# Amsterdam museum
Originally from https://bitbucket.org/biktorrr/amlod (thousands of objects) Which was derived from public collection website (www.amsterdammuseum.nl/collectie/) Data published under Creative Commons Attribution license (CC-by)

The collection and vocabularies are found in the am_dive folder.

**Collection Subset**
Now, all objects from the datadump are in. In total, there are 73,447 objects with 5.7Million triples.

**Amsterdam Museum Thesaurus**
the thesaurus used to annotate AM objects. This is (partially) aligned with GTAA.

# Tropenmuseum
Originally from the old 2004 data we converted for the eculture project (eculture.multimedian.nl). This consists of some 70.000 objects. This is most likely the same as http://www.opencultuurdata.nl/wiki/tropenmuseum/. That dataset has CC-by-SA 3.0. 

Changes made are a) added new locations of images based on the updated wereldculturen.nl api. image URIs are based on work IDs and b) changed the namespace of kit triples from hash to slash URIs and removed whitespaces from URIs

The collection and vocabularies are found in the kit_dive folder.

**Collection subset**
Now all objects are in the dataset. This adds up to 78,270 objects and 1.9 Million triples

**SVCN**
the thesaurus used to annotate Tropenmuseum objects. This is (partially) aligned with GTAA.
There is also a list of actors (for now unaligned)
